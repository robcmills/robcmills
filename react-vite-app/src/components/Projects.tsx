        While I typically tend to spend 125% of my time and energy on "work"
        (related to my employer), I do try to find some time to work on fun side
        projects. Here is a list of a few projects I consider <i>mostly</i>{' '}
        finished. Of course I have a much longer list of unfinished projects.
        Don't we all, right? ðŸ˜…

        <p>I created a custom keyboard called the Karn.</p>

        </a>
        <p>
          It's a split, low-profile, ortholinear (non-staggered), 38-key
          keyboard. Every key is within one key distance from the home row. Very
          comfortable! I have noticed much less shoulder and neck pain after
          switching. I've been using it for about 6 months now, and this is
          definitely my "endgame" keyboard.

          Simple abstract strategy board game I created, that involves moving
          your tokens around a hexagonal board and stacking hexes of your color
          to accumulate points. Simple rules, emergent strategy.
